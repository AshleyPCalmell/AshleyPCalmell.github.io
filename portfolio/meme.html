<p style="text-align:center;">You may be wondering who all these men are and what their significance/ relation is. Well from right to left we have the "king" himself Elvis Presley, Woody Allen, and the famous rapper Drake. For their relation, they all are famous men who have also had weird behavior/relationships with minors. Drake has a trend of being very close to young women, and even dating them after they turn 18, Woody Allen had been accused of molesting his adopted daughter and ended up marrying her while he was 62 and she was 27, and Elvis is known for bringing three 14-year old girls on his tour to "wrestle, tickle and kiss" him. Along with this he dated Dixie Locke who was 15 while he was 22. My main point with this meme is to poke at the gross pattern of men in power being involved with minors/ children.</p>
