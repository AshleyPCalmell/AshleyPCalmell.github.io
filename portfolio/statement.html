My name is Ashley Calmell and I am a Latina visual artist in California.

	I am currently studying Digital media Arts and Studio Practice at 
San Jose University. Most of my practice has been rooted in traditional
mediums such as painting, illustration, and ceramics but I have had 
experience with digital illustration/ painting. I plan to advance my
knowledge in 3D modeling, motion graphics, website design, and coding
while getting my B.F.A in Digital Media Arts. While studying I want to 
do internships and get hands-on experience that will allow me to utilize
skills that I learn from classes in a real work environment.

	I hold a special interest in the coding/ website design aspect of 
Digital Media Art and hope to get an internship that will help me explore
that skill more. In this program, I also want to learn more about 3D 
modeling/ animating to bring me closer to my childhood dreams of working
in a studio to help bring stories to life for entertainment platforms.
Working with a team of forward-thinking artists and designers has always
been a goal of mine, and the ability to bring my inspirations into 
the digital world is exactly where I want my art to develop in the future.
Growing up in the digital age has allowed me to get personal experience 
with how influential digital media is to the public as we develop in this
plugged-in world. Expanding an audience on the internet is extremely 
important now, and this is what I hope to utilize with my developing art
shop. I'm coding a website where I can post and sell art that I create 
digitally to a wide audience, and this website will become way more 
professional with my enhanced skills from the DMA program.

	When it comes to creating art I strive to mold things from my 
personal experience in life or things I have an interest in. I was largely
into reading books as a child, but also loved cartoons. I like to make
references to the things I have enjoyed through my art, so other fans
can notice and find a small excitement in the recognition. My
interest in books also reveals my love for telling stories and 
creating a small universe of my own. I believe that some of the most
influential art reveals a story that carries a message, whether happy
or sad. One image on its own can say so much about a story, and reveal
a lot to the audience. This is another reason why I hope to develop 
my visual design skills more, to bring more details to each of my works. 
Exploring multiple mediums is necessary for me to utilize most of my 
artistic creativity, and mixing media is also an important part of that.
Though I am only in the beginning stages of video editing, I want to 
be able to use a mixture of video and 3D modeling to create other artworks.

	My art is used to either invoke emotions from the audience, 
usually positive or reveal a story/ meaning that reflects something
I find important. I want my art to allow the viewer to have a
conversation or ponder what they feel after experiencing it because 
I believe the most powerful thing art can do is encourage a change
in perception.
